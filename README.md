# Eventually

_Eventually_ is a browser extension that helps users become aware of
subconscious browsing behaviors. Sites can be blacklisted, and users must
confirm that they _really_ want to go there. This introduces a brief moment
tht can be used for reflection...

## Getting Started

The extension is still in active development, and for this reason not available
as an add-on in any marketplace. To test it, you have to use the development
mode.

1. Install [Mozilla Firefox](https://firefox.com)
1. Install [web-ext], a tool to develop, test, and run web extensions in Firefox
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it
1. Run `web-ext run` to temporarily add the extension to Firefox
